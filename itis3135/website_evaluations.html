        <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
        <section>
        <h3>Well Designed Website</h3>

        <h3><a href="https://www.apple.com" target="_blank">Apple</a></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Contrast: It uses strong contrast with large bold headlines and slideshow for new products.</li>
            <li>Repetition: Apple uses the same fonts and color scheme making the website look clean.</li>
            <li>Alignment: Most of the content is alligned very neatly, the text and images line up making it very structured and professional.</li>
            <li>Proximity: Product name, price and description are all grouped together with proper spacing, this makes it easy to understand the information.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Poorly Designed Website</h3>

        <h3><a href="https://www.yahoo.com" target="_blank">Yahoo</a></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Contrast: Low contrast between text and background on many pages makes text difficult to read.</li>
            <li>Repetition: Inconsistent use of fonts, colors, and styles; links and headers do not follow a pattern, leading to visual confusion.</li>
            <li>Alignment: Layout feels cluttered.</li>
            <li>Proximity: Ads and content are too close together.</li>
        </ul>
